# Product Charter

## Authority Boundary

This charter owns the sellable first-generation P0 promise and non-claims.
The screenless modular EgoCore requirements and release evidence remain defined
in [EGO_MASTER_CONTEXT.md](EGO_MASTER_CONTEXT.md), ADR-0008 and ADR-0011.
Current development boards are evidence vehicles for this P0; they do not
freeze or prove the sales-product PCB, enclosure, BOM, ingress, endurance, RF,
audio, waterproofing, or compliance behavior.

Ego Link is the wearable/mobile companion node for Project EGO.

The P0 product is a reliable safety locator and family-contact device. It is
not a standalone brain, phone replacement, cloud-AI product, general camera-AI
platform, or finished mass-production design.

## Product Role

- Wearable sensing and user confirmation node.
- Low-friction safety interaction surface.
- Remote communication and location evidence entry point.
- Development bridge into the larger EGO ecosystem.

Long-term complex memory, multimodal understanding, and broader coordination belong with Ego Base. During P0, the PC Development Bridge is only a development bridge and observer, not the formal Ego Base and not a product dependency.

## Current Product Promise

P0 must pass all three user-facing capability Gates:

- `P0-LOC`: a guardian opens the minimum Guardian client and sees the best
  current explainable location, update age, source, confidence and uncertainty;
- `P0-CALL`: the guardian can call the device and the device can initiate a
  stable two-way full-duplex Ego Call over LTE data;
- `P0-SOS`: a long physical-button press immediately starts local feedback,
  durable SOS recording, location escalation, guardian notification and Ego
  Call with honest delivery/session state.

The minimum first-generation user story is therefore: know where the device
is, speak in either direction, and press SOS to establish location plus human
contact. A P0 release is forbidden unless all three Gates are `PASS`.

Product-demo and field-test evidence must obey
`docs/product/PRODUCT_DEMO_PRIVACY_BOUNDARY.md`: no raw audio/image retention
by default, no unredacted private coordinates in current docs or generated
summaries, no raw Wi-Fi BSSID retention, and no training use without explicit
consent and privacy review.

## Non-Claims

P0 does not claim:

- production fall/anomaly/context-understanding accuracy;
- AI location fusion or learned Sensor Policy readiness;
- camera understanding or camera-dependent safety;
- public emergency dispatch, PSTN, SMS, or native VoLTE;
- polished complete consumer App, multi-party calling, AI voice or recording;
- final enclosure, battery life, power, RF, waterproofing, acoustics, BOM,
  compliance or wearable ergonomics before their measured Gates pass.
